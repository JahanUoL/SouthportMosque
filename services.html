						<h1> Our Services </h1>
						
						
						<div class="mainText">				
							<p>Southport Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre is here to  serve the town of Southport and the wider public in all matters related to the religion of Islam. There is and will never be a limit to our services as it is our God given duty to fulfil the needs of the public at all times. We will continuously  strive to increase and improve our services in a professional manner. At present the following services are available at Southport Mosque and Islamic Cultural centre:</p>

							<p><u class="sectionheadings">Daily prayers (Salah)</u><br />
								The 5 daily payers are held in congregation daily. For  information on congregational times please refer to the Prayer (Salah)  timetable.</p>
								
							<p><u class="sectionheadings">Friday Prayer (Jummah Prayer)</u><br />
								The Friday Prayer begins at 1:15pm during the winter months  and at 1:30pm during summer. A lecture in English is delivered half an hour before  the commencement of the Jummah sermon and Salah. <br />
								The Jummah Salah and sermon usually last between 15-20  minutes. Please arrive as early as possible as at times it is very difficult to  find a parking space close to the Mosque and you may have to park your car well  away from the Masjid.</p>

							<p><u class="sectionheadings">Islamic Classes (Madrassa) for children</u><br />
							At present this takes place every Saturday and Sunday from  11am till 1pm. Children aged 5 and upwards are welcome and are taught a variety  of topics on the subject of Islam including Arabic and Islamic jurisprudence.  We currently have three classes with about sixty children attending in total.  Children are put into classes according to age and the lessons are conducted in  English. A weekly fee of &pound;2 per child is  charged.<br />
							If you would like your child to attend or require further  information, please speak to the Imam in person or drop him an email.</p>

							<p><u class="sectionheadings">Funeral Service</u><br />
							An Islamic funeral service can be conducted by Southport  Mosque. At present the Mosque lacks washing facilities for the deceased,  therefore this ritual is carried out at Southport Hospital.  Southport Mosque has also purchased a portion of the graveyard on Liverpool Road  which is solely for the burial of deceased Muslims. The piece of land is  sufficient for 500 graves.<br />
							In the case that a death should take place please contact  any senior member of the Mosque immediately for advice and funeral  arrangements. <br />

							<p><u class="sectionheadings">Marriage Service</u><br />
							Anybody wishing to have an Islamic marriage conducted by the  Imam can request this by contacting the Imam. The Imam will conduct the  marriage at the Mosque premises but can also offer this service at alternative  venues. A charge of &pound;60 is made to cover administration costs and the issue of  a certificate. <br />
							Marriage by Muslim men to non-Muslim ladies will be  conducted by the Imam on the condition that the bride-to-be is either a  Christian or a Jew; marriage to an atheist or a follower of any other faith is  not permissible in Islam.<br />
							Marriage by Muslim women to non-Muslim men is not  permissible in Islam; therefore a request to have such a marriage conducted by  the Imam cannot be accepted. </p>

							<p><u class="sectionheadings">Counselling and advice in the light of religious  teachings.</u><br />
							The Imam is always at hand to offer counselling and advice  on general issues. If you wish to speak to the Imam in person, this is usually  possible during all congregational prayers. Alternatively you can contact him  to arrange a meeting at other times.</p>
